Our founder, Mr. Attlee Shen, has 35 years of experience in factory management, product design, and brand integration. Mr. Attlee Shen’s father started a cosmetic factory when he was 10, which enlightened Mr. Shen to the world of cosmetic manufacturing. 
<br><br>
            <b>In 1983</b>, Mr. Shen dedicated himself in transforming the company into one that’s systemized and automatized, which created exponential growth for the company. 
<br><br>
            <b>In 1992</b>, he set up a factory overseas to strengthen the company’s competitiveness. 
<br><br>
Mr. Shen led the family-owned business successfully to become one of the leading color cosmetic manufactures between 1990 and 2000.
<br><br>
            <b>In 2003</b>, he directed his focus to brand integration; his sense of fashion and ability of integration brought a Japanese hundred dollar store back to life; Furthermore, some of his items rivaled several well-known brands and topped the bestselling charts, creating a wild sensation. 
<br><br>
            <b>In 2015</b>, Mr. Shen is ready to take on the world of cosmetics manufacturing with his very own Hoschoc Enterprise Co., Ltd. We strive to continually advance our teams in product development (including packaging, catalog, and display cases), formula development, sales and services, and regulation compliance. Our team is young yet with enough experience to help our clients with any product related questions and meet their requirements.  
<br><br>
            <b>In 2018</b>,  our factory is ISO22716 certified, with SA8000 certification expected by the end of the year. We'll continue to grow and improve our capabilities and qualifications to give our clients speedy and competitive services!
